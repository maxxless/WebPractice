            <h1>History</h1>
            <p><b>Early life:</b> Belmonte's father opened the Orange Ten Pin Bowl when Jason was a toddler. As a
                result, he
                started rolling a ball at 1 year and 6 months old. Interviewed in 2009, he commented: "The only problem
                for me
                though was as an 18-month-old baby boy lifting a nine- to 10-pound (4-4.5kg) bowling ball ... it was a
                little
                hard, so like all babies I pushed the ball with two hands."In doing so he developed a two-handed style
                which he
                uses today, placing only two fingers and no thumb in the ball to produce more revolutions. He started
                competing at
                the age of three, winning his first event at the age of four. At the age of five, he had a league
                average of 117
                and a high game of 179. Belmonte was described by friends as motivated and compassionate. He also
                participated in
                many local charity events in his youth.</p>
            <p><b>Amateur and international accomplishments:</b> Aged seventeen, Belmonte became the first Junior
                Australian to
                bowl a 300 game overseas. He also took five Gold medals at the 2000 Junior National Championships, was
                selected
                for the Youth Australia team, and also held a place in this team in 2002 and 2004. Belmonte was awarded
                the 2001
                Orange Junior Sportsperson of the Year and won the 2002 Senior Award. He also was awarded the Orange
                Sportsperson
                of the Year award in both 2002 and 2003. Belmonte won one gold, one silver and two bronze medals at the
                2002
                Commonwealth Championships in Scotland and a silver medal at the WTBA World Youth Championships in
                Thailand. Later
                in the year, he was selected in the Australian Open men's team, where he remains to the present time.</p>
            <p>In 2004, Belmonte took three gold, one silver and one bronze in the Asian Youth FIQ in Hong Kong and
                followed
                this up in the World Youth FIQ titles in Guam with a gold in the singles and a gold in all events. He
                won the
                prestigious 2004 Bowler of the Year award, voted by the Board of Directors of the World Bowlers
                Writers'
                Association. Belmonte was invited to participate in the 2005 World Tenpin Masters in England where he
                was defeated
                in the semi-finals. In this event, he made history by bowling the first-ever 300 game in the event. The
                game was
                filmed by Matchroom Sport. Belmonte represented Australia in the 2006 World Youth Championships in
                Berlin. He was
                part of the team to take the gold medal in the Team Event and went on to make the Masters after
                finishing in sixth
                place in the All Events. He was defeated in the second step of the Masters by the eventual winner, Mads
                Sandbaekken from Norway. In 2007, Belmonte was once again invited to take part in the World Tenpin
                Masters, held
                at the Barnsley Metrodome. After defeating the defending champion Chris Barnes of the United States in
                the
                semi-finals, Belmonte went on to defeat England's Paul Moor in the finals where he rolled the event's
                second-ever
                300 game. Belmonte rolled 23 out of a possible 24 strikes to win the event with a 566 score for two
                games, against
                Moor's 524.</p>
            <p>Belmonte participated in the 2007 World Ranking Masters and after qualifying in second position, was
                defeated in
                the quarter finals by eventual runner-up Peter Ljung from Sweden, 2–0 (190–258, 158–279), finishing in
                sixth
                place.</p>

            <p>2011, World Bowling Tour, Jason defeated good friend and PBA Player Mike Fagan, 300–205, to win the 2011
                Thailand Open.</p>
            <p><b>AMF WORLD CUP:</b> Jason Belmonte competed in the 2004 AMF World Cup in Singapore, the most
                prestigious
                individual tournament in bowling, where he was lead qualifier and never lost the lead in five days of
                qualifying
                events, finishing in 5th place after being knocked out in the quarter final.</p>

            <p>Belmonte competed again in the 2007 AMF World Cup in [St. Petersburg, Russia] where he was also lead
                qualifier
                and as well all final rounds. Finishing as runner-up after defeated in the final by Bill Hoffman (USA).
                In the
                first match Hoffman defeated Andres Gomes (Colombia). Petteri Salonen (Finland) hit a new Bowling World
                Cup record
                for six games when he amassed 1538 pins in the second qualifying block at the 43rd QubicaAMF Bowling
                World Cup.
                His series included back to back 279 games (247, 220, 256, 279, 279, 257) which beats the 1513 set by
                Jason
                Belmonte in 2004 in Singapore. It was a little consolation that Jason won the country rankings for
                Australia with
                Ann-Maree Putney, she won the trophy in the women's. Ann-Maree Putney (Australia) bowled superbly, (280
                and 247).
                Her total of 527 is just one short of the all-time record for two games in the TV finals.</p>

            <p>In his 3rd appearance in the 2011 AMF World Cup in (Johannesburg, South Africa) he finally have been
                crowned as
                AMF Bowling World Cup champion. His first match was against Mykhaylo Kalika (Ukraine), Jason won by
                237-203 but it
                was a different story in the second game, 248-266. So we were into a deciding game, which Jason won by
                266-185.
                Jason Belomonte then came up against first seed Tommy Jones (USA). The first game was high scoring,
                259-279. Jason
                came back and won the second, 247-216. So yet again we needed a decider. What a game it was, strike for
                strike
                until Tommy opened the 8th frame. It was up to Jason to close the 10th frame, which he did in style,
                259-236 and
                becoming the first Australian man to take the title. Jason’s three game total of 765 is a new finals
                record, just
                beating the previous mark of 764 by Petter Hansen (Norway), set in Singapore in 2004.</p>

            <p>Quote Jason Belmonte; “I was a long way in the lead in 2004 in Singapore, and got knocked in the
                quarters,” he
                said, “and again I led the field in St Petersburg in 2007 and then I lost in the final. So I was happy
                to go in as
                number two seed this time".</p>
