				<p><b>Early life:</b> Belmonte's father opened the Orange Ten Pin Bowl when Jason was a toddler. As a result, he started rolling a ball at 1 year and 6 months old. Interviewed in 2009, he commented: "The only problem for me though was as an 18-month-old baby boy lifting a nine- to 10-pound (4-4.5kg) bowling ball ... it was a little hard, so like all babies I pushed the ball with two hands."In doing so he developed a two-handed style which he uses today, placing only two fingers and no thumb in the ball to produce more revolutions. He started competing at the age of three, winning his first event at the age of four. At the age of five, he had a league average of 117 and a high game of 179. Belmonte was described by friends as motivated and compassionate. He also participated in many local charity events in his youth.</p>
				<p><b>Amateur and international accomplishments:</b> Aged seventeen, Belmonte became the first Junior Australian to bowl a 300 game overseas. He also took five Gold medals at the 2000 Junior National Championships, was selected for the Youth Australia team, and also held a place in this team in 2002 and 2004. Belmonte was awarded the 2001 Orange Junior Sportsperson of the Year and won the 2002 Senior Award. He also was awarded the Orange Sportsperson of the Year award in both 2002 and 2003. Belmonte won one gold, one silver and two bronze medals at the 2002 Commonwealth Championships in Scotland and a silver medal at the WTBA World Youth Championships in Thailand. Later in the year, he was selected in the Australian Open men's team, where he remains to the present time.</p>
                <p>In 2004, Belmonte took three gold, one silver and one bronze in the Asian Youth FIQ in Hong Kong and followed this up in the World Youth FIQ titles in Guam with a gold in the singles and a gold in all events. He won the prestigious 2004 Bowler of the Year award, voted by the Board of Directors of the World Bowlers Writers' Association. Belmonte was invited to participate in the 2005 World Tenpin Masters in England where he was defeated in the semi-finals. In this event, he made history by bowling the first-ever 300 game in the event. The game was filmed by Matchroom Sport. Belmonte represented Australia in the 2006 World Youth Championships in Berlin. He was part of the team to take the gold medal in the Team Event and went on to make the Masters after finishing in sixth place in the All Events. He was defeated in the second step of the Masters by the eventual winner, Mads Sandbaekken from Norway. In 2007, Belmonte was once again invited to take part in the World Tenpin Masters, held at the Barnsley Metrodome. After defeating the defending champion Chris Barnes of the United States in the semi-finals, Belmonte went on to defeat England's Paul Moor in the finals where he rolled the event's second-ever 300 game. Belmonte rolled 23 out of a possible 24 strikes to win the event with a 566 score for two games, against Moor's 524.</p>
				<p>Belmonte participated in the 2007 World Ranking Masters and after qualifying in second position, was defeated in the quarter finals by eventual runner-up Peter Ljung from Sweden, 2–0 (190–258, 158–279), finishing in sixth place.</p>

				<p>2011, World Bowling Tour, Jason defeated good friend and PBA Player Mike Fagan, 300–205, to win the 2011 Thailand Open.</p>
				<p><b>AMF WORLD CUP:</b> Jason Belmonte competed in the 2004 AMF World Cup in Singapore, the most prestigious individual tournament in bowling, where he was lead qualifier and never lost the lead in five days of qualifying events, finishing in 5th place after being knocked out in the quarter final.</p>

				<p>Belmonte competed again in the 2007 AMF World Cup in [St. Petersburg, Russia] where he was also lead qualifier and as well all final rounds. Finishing as runner-up after defeated in the final by Bill Hoffman (USA). In the first match Hoffman defeated Andres Gomes (Colombia). Petteri Salonen (Finland) hit a new Bowling World Cup record for six games when he amassed 1538 pins in the second qualifying block at the 43rd QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup. His series included back to back 279 games (247, 220, 256, 279, 279, 257) which beats the 1513 set by Jason Belmonte in 2004 in Singapore. It was a little consolation that Jason won the country rankings for Australia with Ann-Maree Putney, she won the trophy in the women's. Ann-Maree Putney (Australia) bowled superbly, (280 and 247). Her total of 527 is just one short of the all-time record for two games in the TV finals.</p>

				<p>In his 3rd appearance in the 2011 AMF World Cup in (Johannesburg, South Africa) he finally have been crowned as AMF Bowling World Cup champion. His first match was against Mykhaylo Kalika (Ukraine), Jason won by 237-203 but it was a different story in the second game, 248-266. So we were into a deciding game, which Jason won by 266-185. Jason Belomonte then came up against first seed Tommy Jones (USA). The first game was high scoring, 259-279. Jason came back and won the second, 247-216. So yet again we needed a decider. What a game it was, strike for strike until Tommy opened the 8th frame. It was up to Jason to close the 10th frame, which he did in style, 259-236 and becoming the first Australian man to take the title. Jason’s three game total of 765 is a new finals record, just beating the previous mark of 764 by Petter Hansen (Norway), set in Singapore in 2004.</p>

				<p>Quote Jason Belmonte; “I was a long way in the lead in 2004 in Singapore, and got knocked in the quarters,” he said, “and again I led the field in St Petersburg in 2007 and then I lost in the final. So I was happy to go in as number two seed this time".</p>
