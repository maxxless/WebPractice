        he browser location bar is perhaps the geekiest mainstream piece of user interface in the world.
        There are URLs on billboards, on the sides of trains, and even in street graffiti. Combined with
        the back button — easily the most important button in the browser — you have a powerful way to go
        forward and backward through the vast set of intertwingled resources called the Web.

        The <a href="">HTML5 history API</a> is a standardized way to manipulate the browser history via script.
        Part of this API — navigating the history — has been available in previous versions of HTML. The new parts
        in HTML5 include a way to add entries to the browser history, to visibly change the URL in the browser location
        bar (without triggering a page refresh), and an event that fires when those entries are removed from the stack
        by the user pressing the browser’s back button. This means that the URL in the browser location bar can continue
        to do its job as a unique identifier for the current resource, even in script-heavy applications that don’t ever
        perform a full page refresh.
        </font>
      </p>
      <h2 align="center">&#10087;</h2>
      <h1 align="center">THE WHY</h1>
      <p><img src="img/3.png" alt="demon reading book" width="218" height="231" align="left">
      </p>
      <p>
        <font face="Copperplate">
        Why would you manually manipulate the browser location? After all, a simple link can navigate to a new URL; that’s the
        way the web has worked for 20 years. And it will continue to work that way. This API doesn’t try to subvert the web.
        Just the opposite. In recent years, web developers have found new and exciting ways of subverting the web without any
        help from emerging standards. The HTML5 history API is actually designed to ensure that URLs continue to be useful in
        script-heavy web applications.
        </font>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font face="Copperplate">
        Going back to first principles, what does a URL do? It identifies a unique resource. You can link to it directly; you
        can bookmark it; search engines can index it; you can copy and paste it and email it to someone else, who can click
        it and end up seeing the same resource you saw originally. These are all excellent qualities. URLs matter.
        </font>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font face="Copperplate">
        So we want unique resources to have unique URLs. But at the same time, browsers have always had a fundamental
        limitation: if you change the URL, even through script, it triggers a roundtrip to the remote web server and a
        full page refresh. This takes time and resources, and it seems especially wasteful when you are navigating to a
        page that is substantially similar to the current page. Everything on the new page gets downloaded, even the parts
        that are exactly the same as the current page. There is no way tell a browser to change the URL but only download
        half a page.
        </font>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font face="Copperplate">
        The HTML5 history API lets you do this. Instead of triggering a full page refresh, you can use script to, in essence,
        download half a page. This illusion is tricky to pull off, and it requires some work on your part. Are you watching
        closely?

        Let’s say you have two pages, page A and page B. The two pages are 90% identical; only 10% of the page content is
        different. The user navigates to page A, then tries to navigate to page B. But instead of triggering a full page
        refresh, you interrupt this navigation and do the following steps manually:
        </font>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <font face="Copperplate">
        <li><em>Load the 10% of the page</em> from page B that is different from page A (probably using XMLHttpRequest).
          This will require some server-side changes to your web application. You will need to write code to return just
          the 10% of page B that is different from page A. This can be a hidden URL or query parameter that the end user
          would not normally see.
          </li>
        <li><em>Swap in the changed content</em> (using innerHTML or other DOM methods). You may also need to reset
          any event handlers on elements within the swapped-in content.
          </li>
        <li><em>Update the browser location bar</em> with the URL> of page B, using a particular method from the HTML5
          history API> that I’ll show you in a moment.
          </li>
          </font>
        </ol>
        <p><font face="Copperplate">
          At the end of this illusion (if you executed it correctly), the browser ends up with a DOM that is identical to
          page B, just as if you had navigated to page B directly. The browser location bar ends up with a URL that is identical
          to page B, just as if you had navigated to page B directly. But you never really did navigate to page B, and you never
          did a full page refresh. That’s the illusion. But because the “compiled” page looks the same as page B and has the same
          URL as page B, the user should never notice the difference (nor appreciate all your hard work micromanaging their
          experience).

          The HTML5 history API is just a handful of methods on the window.history object, plus one event on the window object.
          You can use these to <a href="">detect support for the history API</a>. Support is currently limited to the very latest
          versions of a few browsers, putting these techniques squarely in the “progressive enhancement” camp.

          <a href="">dive into dogs</a> is a straightforward but non-trivial example of using the HTML5 history API. It
          demonstrates a common pattern: a long article with an associated inline photo gallery. In a supported browser,
          navigating the Next and Previous links in the photo gallery will update the photo in place <em>and update the URL
          in the browser location bar</em>, without triggering a full page refresh. In unsupported browsers — or, indeed,
          supported browsers where the user has disabled scripting — the links simply function as regular links, taking you
          to a new page with a full page refresh.

                  your chance to complete the illusion once and for all. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you
                  have to bring it back.

                  In this demonstration, “bringing it back” is as simple as swapping in the original photo, which we do by
                  calling the swapPhoto() with the current location. By the time your popstate callback is called, the URL
                  visible in the browser’s location bar has been changed to the previous URL. Also, the global location
                  property has already been updated with the previous URL.

                <p><font face="Copperplate">
                  To help you visualize this, let’s step through the entire illusion from the beginning
                  to the end:
                </font></p>
                <ul><font face="Copperplate">
                  <li>User loads <a href="">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/fer.html</a>, sees story and a photo of Fer.
                  </li>
                  <li>User clicks the link labeled “Next,” an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element whose href property is <a href="">
                    http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/casey.html</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>Instead of navigating <code><a href="examples/history/casey.html">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/casey.html</a></code>
                    with a full page refresh, the custom click handler on the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element traps the click and executes its
                    own code.
                  </li>
                  <li>Our custom click handler calls the swapPhoto() function, which creates an XMLHttpRequest object to synchronously
                    download the HTML snippet located at <a href="">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/<strong>gallery</strong>/casey.html</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>The swapPhoto() function sets the innerHTML property of the photo gallery wrapper (an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element)
                    , thereby replacing the captioned photo of Fer with a captioned photo of Casey.
                  </li>
                  <li>Finally, our custom click handler calls the history.pushState() function to manually change the URL in the browser’s
                    location bar to <a href="">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/casey.html</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>User clicks the browser’s back button.</li>
                  <li>The browser notices that a URL has been manually pushed onto the history stack (by the history.pushState()
                   function). Instead of navigating to the previous URL and redrawing the entire page, the browser simply
                   updates the location bar to the previous URL (<a href="">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/fer.html
                   </a>) and fires a popstate event.
                  </li>
                  <li>Our custom popstate handler calls the swapPhoto() function again, this time with the previous URL that
                    by now is already visible in the browser’s location bar.
                  </li>
                  <li>Again using XMLHttpRequest, the swapPhoto() function downloads a snippet of HTML located at <a href="">
                    http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/<strong>gallery</strong>/fer.html</a> and sets the innerHTML property of
                    the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> wrapper element, thereby replacing the captioned photo of Casey with a captioned photo
                    of Fer.
                  </li>
                </font></ul>
                <p><font face="Copperplate">
                  The illusion is complete. All visible evidence (the content of the page, and the URL in the location bar)
                  suggests to the user that they have navigated forward one page and backward one page. But no full page
                  refresh ever occurred — it was all a meticulously executed illusion.
